# User-Uploaded HTML Dashboard

This project is a web application built with **Flask** and designed for containerized deployment. It allows users to upload a custom HTML file (which is served as the main page) and an optional CSV data file. The application is configured to run efficiently in a Docker container using the high-performance package manager **uv** and the production-ready WSGI server **gunicorn**.

### Features

  * **File Upload:** Easily upload a custom `index.html` file and an optional `data.csv` file.
  * **Persistent File Naming:** The uploaded HTML and CSV files are automatically renamed to `index.html` and `data.csv`, respectively, to ensure consistent serving.
  * **Original Filenames:** The application displays the original filenames of the uploaded files for better user context.
  * **File Management:** Provides the ability to delete uploaded files directly from the web interface.
  * **Containerized Deployment:** Ready to be built and run as a Docker container, ensuring a consistent and portable environment.

## How to Run

To get this application up and running, you will need **Docker** installed on your system.

### 1\. Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command to build the Docker image. The `Dockerfile` uses `uv` to install dependencies and `gunicorn` to serve the application.

```bash
docker build -t html-dashboard .
```

### 2\. Run the Docker Container

After the image is built, you can run the container and map port 5000 from the container to port 5000 on your host machine.

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 html-dashboard
```

The application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  **Navigate to the home page (`/`)**: Upon opening the application, if no `index.html` file has been uploaded, you will be automatically redirected to the file upload page.
2.  **Upload files**: On the `/upload_files` page, you can select an HTML file and an optional CSV file.
3.  **Manage files**: The upload page displays a list of currently uploaded files, including their original names, and provides a **"Delete"** button for each.
4.  **View the dashboard**: Once an `index.html` file is uploaded, your custom web page will be available at the `/o2site` endpoint. This is where your uploaded HTML and any associated data can be viewed.
